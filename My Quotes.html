<h1><em>QUOTES</em></h1>
<li> "it's cool guy"</li>
<ul>
<li> "I wanna be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,
To train them is my cause.

I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me
I know its my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
(Po-ke-mon) Gotta catch 'em all

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Pokemon!

(Gotta catch 'em all)

It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

Pokemon!

Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend.

Pokemon!

A heart so true.
Our courage will pull us through.
You teach me and I'll teach you.

Pokemon!

(Gotta catch 'em all)x5

Pokemon!

It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

Pokemon!

Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend.

Pokemon!

A heart so true.
Our courage will pull us through.
You teach me and I'll teach you.

POKEMON!
Gotta catch'em all!!
Gotta catch'em all!!
POKEMON!!!
