<h1 style="color:#FFF">Present</h1>
<p style="color:#F00">The internet has given much to the genre. Smaller bands have a better reach to people all across the world. Audiences have grown in size, and listening to music has become all around easier. A fan can download a discography in 10 minutes, while a record collecter would take years. More people learn where and when shows are, and how to get to venues. Things have improved exponentially for the underground music scene. </p>
