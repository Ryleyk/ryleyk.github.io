<h1 style="color:#FFF">History</h1>
<p style="color:#F00">Hardcore originated in the late 70's/early 80's. Infamous scenes shaping the genre were New York, Detroit, Boston, and many, many others. Hardcore still exists today, and is in full throttle. Famous hardcore bands include Hatebreed, Youth of Today, and Warzone. New York Hardcore is the most renouned and infamous, as the city/state pumped out over 50 iconinc bands. Over time, cities from across the U.S, and eventually from across the world, began spitting out great bands. Fans of the genre today often listen to the bands of yesterday reminiscing of what once was. Bands also cover the legendary bands often.</p>
