<h1 style="color:#FFF">Subgenres</h1>
<ul style="color:#F00">
<p>There are many different styles of hardcore.</p> 
<li>There is the traditional approach, with simple power chords called <strong> Youth Crew.</strong></li>
<li>There is also the newer, more intimidating, <strong>Beatdown</strong> with low tunings, slow tempos, and inhumane heaviness.</li>
<li>Another, fairly new style is <strong>Metalcore,</strong>which is very technical, and much more distasteful to one that knows nothing about hardcore. </li>
<li>Finally, there is <strong>Crossover</strong> which is played at breakneck speed. Crossover is a style of the genre that is fused with thrash metal, like Metallica or Slayer. </li>
