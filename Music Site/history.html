<h1 style="color:#FFF">History</h1>
<p style="color:#FFF">Hardcore originated in the late 70's/early 80's. Infamous scenes shaping the genre were New York, Detroit, Boston, and many, many others. Hardcore still exists today, and is in full throttle. Famous hardcore bands include Hatebreed, Youth of Today, and Warzone.</p>
